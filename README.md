#### Overview

The goal of this project was to create a static clone of the papergrid website's layout using HTML and CSS. This project helps in understanding basic web page structure, layout techniques, and UI design elements.

Please note: The website is not responsive, meaning it does not adjust well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.). It is built as a desktop-first design.

#### Features

Home Page: Includes a hero section, navigation bar, and book search section.

Search Functionality: Static search bar (doesn't perform any dynamic search).

#### Technologies Used

HTML5: Used to structure the website's content.

CSS3: Used for styling the website, including layouts, colors, typography, and more.
